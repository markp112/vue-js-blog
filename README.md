# Sparkz CMS

this is a persoanl project built in VueJS with the goal being to build an application that allows a user to build a static website where they can add, edit and delete content and push this to a hosted static website on an Amazon AWS S3 bucket.

the application is built in VueJs and makes use of AWS DynamoDb with Lambda functions and API Gateway.

This application is still very much work in progress. 

There is an UI where the user can design a page layout, design a nav bar choose and edit a colour palette with all of the content being pushed to DynamoDb.
